# Create a Magic Move in Keynote for Mac
By Jarrett Schaefer


### Why Magic Move?

For many members of the “cult of Mac,” Keynote for Mac is their go-to slide presentation software. It’s sleek and lightweight, yet surprisingly powerful. However, many Mac users are unaware of one of Keynote’s most useful and versatile features: the Magic Move transition.

Magic Move automatically animates common elements that change between slides. If an image or block of text moves position or size, Magic Move will make the transition continuous and smooth. Whether you’re making a slideshow for a school final or trying to “land the big account” in the corporate world, Magic Move can give a presentation a level of polish and pizzaz that will separate it from the rest.

These instructions will guide you through the basics of creating a Magic Move transition. You’ll need a Mac laptop or desktop computer, a copy of Keynote (version 6.0 or later), and an already existing Keynote presentation to play around with. You don’t need to be a “pro-user” to create a Magic Move, but it will help to have a basic understanding of Keynote concepts like transitions, formatting, sidebars, and slide navigation. If you need to brush up on your terminology (“Where is the Slide Navigator, again?”), you can browse Apple’s User Guide for Keynote for a quick refresher. 


### Creating a Magic Move in an existing project

1. In an existing Keynote project, locate a slide with an element you’d like to create a Magic Move transition for.

2. Select that slide in the Slide Navigator and duplicate it by pressing ⌘+D. You should see the duplicate directly beneath your original slide.

3. Select the duplicated slide in the Slide Navigator if it’s not already selected.

4. Select any element in the duplicated slide and reshape it or move it to a new position. You can do this with any picture, shape, or text.

5. Select the original slide in your Slide Navigator. 

6. In the sidebar, be sure the Animate tab is selected. You should see the Add an Effect button beneath it.


7. Select the Add an Effect button. You will see a dropdown menu.

8. In the dropdown menu, select Magic Move. This will apply the Magic Move transition to your slides. 

9. Click the Preview button on the sidebar to see how it looks.

10. Use the sidebar to customize Magic Move. For example, you can adjust the duration of the transition by dragging the Duration slider.

### Reflection

Since this procedure is intended for Keynote for Mac, I decided to move forward with a format that would look best on a laptop or desktop. While users may be looking at the instructions on a phone or tablet and then following the procedures on a Mac, I think it’s more likely that they would be doing both on a Mac (switching between Keynote and the instructions in a separate window). I also assumed that most users would have a basic understanding of Keynote; Magic Move is a borderline “advanced” transition, and I think users who are interested in it would already be familiar with Keynote basics.

I had a hard time deciding how much of the window to show in a screenshot. If I zoom in on a specific section of Keynote (just the sidebar, for example), there isn’t a lot of context to show users where they are on the screen. If I zoomed out too much, it would be hard to read the content that was important. I decided to err on the side of zooming in on a section of the screen, so users could read the copy in those sections more clearly.
